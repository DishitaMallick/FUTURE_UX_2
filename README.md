# FUTURE_UX_2

TARGET USERS
The app is designed primarily for students, young professionals and busy individuals who prefer quick and convenient café ordering. These users value speed, clarity and a visually appealing interface that makes browsing and ordering effortless. The warm aesthetic also targets users who enjoy a cozy café experience in a digital format.

BOOKING FLOW LOGIC
The booking flow follows a simple and intuitive structure: users enter through login/signup, browse categories (Coffee, Tea, Savoury), add items to cart, optionally schedule a pickup time, confirm the order, and track its progress. Each step is logically connected to reduce friction and ensure smooth task completion. The schedule feature adds flexibility, while the track order screen reinforces transparency.

UX DECISIONS
The UX focuses on clarity, consistency, and simplicity. A soft beige and coffee-brown palette reinforces brand identity, while rounded components create a friendly and approachable feel. Clear visual hierarchy is maintained through strong headings, structured spacing, and prominent primary buttons. Sections are grouped in cards to improve scannability, and minimal text reduces cognitive overload.

FOCUS ON UI DESIGN
This project is mainly focused on UI design quality. Special attention was given to consistent typography, reusable components, structured spacing, and alignment. The design system uses component-based architecture in Figma, including button variants, tab states, and organized layout grids to maintain scalability and visual harmony.

PROTOTYPE & INTERACTIVE BEHAVIOUR
Interactive prototyping enhances realism and usability. When users click on Coffee, Tea, or Savoury, the product grid updates using component variants with Smart Animate transitions. Bottom navigation icons (Home, Track Order, Schedule Order, Sign Out) simulate real app navigation between screens. These interactive states demonstrate logical UI behavior and create a dynamic, app-like experience within the prototype.

How This Design Improves User Experience?
The design improves user experience by reducing cognitive load, maintaining visual consistency, and guiding users with clear actions at every step. Logical flow, visual feedback, and interactive transitions make the ordering journey intuitive, smooth, and engaging while preserving a warm and cohesive café identity.
